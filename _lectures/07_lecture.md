tldr: We started the class by explaining statically and dynamically allocated arrays. We then introduced static vs. dynamic (growing) arrays in all 4 languages. We introduced the Java ArrayList<>, C++ std::vector<>, Python list [] and C# List<>. We then introduced the C++ class definition syntax in .hpp files in addition to an example where a class has an object member variable.
