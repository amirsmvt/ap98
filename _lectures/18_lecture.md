tldr: "We started this session by introducing the conversion operator and how to overload it for different types. We then motivated the use of exceptions by explaining how it can help us write cleaner code and not cloud our code and methods with error handling parameters. We explained the try/catch block, multiple catch statements and catching all exceptions along with exception filters. We also showed how the exception object contains different information including call stack, error message and error code. Finally we discussed best practices when handling exceptions, what an unhandled exception is and how and when to rethrow and exception. "
