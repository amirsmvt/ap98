tldr: In this session after reviewing exception handling from last session, we provided examples on how the program behaves when exceptions occur. We then provided examples for how several .NET exceptions could occur or could be thrown. Finally we introduced the Finally block and its applications. For the last part of the class we showed a video on atomic habits and had a discussion about it afterwards. You can find the video at the link below.
