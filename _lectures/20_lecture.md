tldr: We introduced the concept of inheritance: What is it? Why we use it? and the C# syntax for it. We started from the C# Object and Exception classes which we had seen before. Next we implemented a Person and Student class separately and saw the overlap in definitions and code. We then had Student inherit from the Person class. We added more classes to the hierarchy by adding Employee who inherits from Person and Teacher who inherits from Employee. We talked about constructors and how base class constructors can/should be called. Next we introduced virtual/override/new methods and polymorphisim. At the end of the class we looked through Assignment 9 and gave some hints on how to approach it.
