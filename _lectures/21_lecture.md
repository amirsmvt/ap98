tldr: We started this session with an implementation of a single Shape class that could draw a Circle, Triangle or Square and saw how the class quickly became complicated. We then defined different classes for each shape, all inheriting from the Shape class and saw how much simpler the class becomes. We then introduced the concept of abstract classes/methods and sealed classes/methods. Finally we introduced extention methods to finish our discussion on inheritance.
