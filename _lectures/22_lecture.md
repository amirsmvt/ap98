tldr: We introduced and motivated the concept of a delegate, lambda expressions and generic predefined Func and Action delegates. We then introduced an extension method for int[] to filter Odd, Dividable by 3, 5, ... numbers and became familiar with chaining multiple methods together. We then introdeuced the LINQ extension methods including the Enumerable class and the Select, Where, Skip, Take, OrderBy, OrderByDescending, GroupBy, ToList and ForEach extension methods while working with Life Expectency data from WHO to find countries with highest/lowest average life expectancy.
