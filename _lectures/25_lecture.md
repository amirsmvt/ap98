tldr: We went through delegate code samples from C# via CLR book. We then introduced events and went through the MailManager example also from C# via CLR book. We then discussed the concept of thread and processes and explored system processes and threads from Process Explorer tool from System Internals (link2). Finally, we introduced how you can create your own thread in C# and start it with with and without parameters. See link1 for complete source code from CLR via C#.
